## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to pman! This application simplifies running multiple AI coding agents in parallel. You can switch easily between them, making your workflow more efficient.

### 🔍 What is pman?

pman allows you to manage several AI coding agents simultaneously. It uses tmux sessions and git worktrees to ensure each agent operates independently without conflicts. Whether you're using Claude Code, Codex, or Aider, pman helps you make the most of your AI tools.

#### Example Interface

You can visualize your sessions like this:

```
┌ Sessions ─────────────────────────────┐
│ > _                                   │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▶ ● claude-auth (myproject)           │
│   ○ codex-tests (myproject)           │
│   ○ aider-refactor (myproject)        │
│   ○ manual-review (myproject)         │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🌟 Why pman?
